Purpose:
This projection aims to automate the literature review process for a large volume of documents discussing economic growth, innovation, and technology.

Methodology:
1. Data collection: Collect a corpous based on 56 academic articles from The Social Science Research Network (SSRN) from targeted key word searches for term such as: "innovation", "economic growth", "research", "intangible", "semiconductor".
2. Data cleaning: Harvest text from pdf, clean and lemmatize text
3. Exploratory analysis: explore the distribution of top 20 most frequently appeared words and the frequency of these words in each documents via a frequency matrix
4. Modeling and Expected Results: model the topics of the corpus and words associated with each topic as well as the probability that a document talks about a topic/topics. 

Potential Next Steps:
1. Sample expansion: Expand the corpus to include non-targeted documents such as government documents on technology and innovation that do not specifically talks about economomic growth or certain sectors (public announcement from government annual report or a country's Science Department are good examples).
2. Additional method: after having a good non-targeted and diverse corpus, perform regression to see if there is any trend in topic of technology and innovation through times (i.e., time refers to date of document pulication)
